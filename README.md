Overview of the project:
SIMPLE CALCULATOR
The Basic Calculator is a Python program designed to perform simple arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Users are prompted to input two numbers and select an operation from a menu. The program then calculates and displays the result while ensuring basic error handling, such as preventing division by zero and validating numeric input. It is an excellent project for beginners to learn Python fundamentals like user input, conditional statements, and basic mathematical computations. This calculator can be enhanced with additional features, making it a versatile and practical tool for understanding programming logic and structure.

TASK-2:

Overview of the project:
STUDENT GRADE TRACKER
The Student Grade Tracker is a Python program designed to manage and analyze student grades by allowing users to input grades for multiple subjects or assignments, calculate the average grade, and display a comprehensive performance summary. It determines the overall letter grade based on predefined thresholds and calculates the Grade Point Average (GPA) on a standard scale. The program ensures valid input, handles errors gracefully, and presents results clearly. It is a practical project for learning Python concepts such as loops, conditionals, data storage, and user-defined functions, with potential for enhancements like weighted grades, data visualization, or file storage integration.
