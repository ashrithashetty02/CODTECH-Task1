Overview of the project:
SIMPLE CALCULATOR
The Basic Calculator is a Python program designed to perform simple arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Users are prompted to input two numbers and select an operation from a menu. The program then calculates and displays the result while ensuring basic error handling, such as preventing division by zero and validating numeric input. It is an excellent project for beginners to learn Python fundamentals like user input, conditional statements, and basic mathematical computations. This calculator can be enhanced with additional features, making it a versatile and practical tool for understanding programming logic and structure.
